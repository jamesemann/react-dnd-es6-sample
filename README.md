# react-dnd-es6-sample
Testing react-dnd with es6. Totally unsupported but feel free to use it if it is useful!

Usage:
This is a dotnet core 2.1 project but dotnet core is not required to use it. After cloning, you can either:

1. **Using dotnet core** From .\ run `dotnet run`
2. **Using npm** From .\ClientApp run `npm start`

If you just want to see it running, you can take a look at [this example running on github.io](https://jamesemann.github.io/reactdndsample/)
